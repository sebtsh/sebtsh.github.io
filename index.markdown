**Prospective employers**: I am on the job market for positions in Singapore starting Aug 2024 and later! You may find my [CV here](./CV.pdf).

# Education
I am a 4th year computer science PhD student at National University of Singapore (NUS) working with [Bryan Low Kian Hsiang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/research.html) and co-advised by [Foo Chuan Sheng](https://ai.stanford.edu/~csfoo/) at A\*STAR. I am a recipient of the A\*STAR Computing and Information Science scholarship. I am currently a visiting student at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), hosted by [Patrick Jaillet](https://web.mit.edu/jaillet/www/).

# Research
My main research interest is adaptive experimental design, specifically via Bayesian optimization. My research intersects machine learning, probability, and optimization, and I hope to apply these techniques to solve real world problems of significance.
